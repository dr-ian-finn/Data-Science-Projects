This notebook scrapes Wikipedia for Toronto postal data and assigns geographic coordinates using geocoder.arcgis. I then retrieve Foursquare data on venues in Toronto proper, and use the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster neighborhoods based on the results.<br />

[*Explaining_NYC_COVID19_Cases*] (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dr-ian-finn/Jupyter-Notebooks/blob/master/Explaining_NYC_COVID19_Cases.ipynb)<br />
This notebook performs a zip-code level analysis of COVID-19 incidence in New York City using regression and machine learning techniques. The results of this analysis are described in the *An Analysis of COVID-19 Incidence in New York City - Paper Format* and *An Analysis of COVID-19 Incidence in New York City - Presentation Format* files, which are located in the *Projects* folder.
