I am a PhD economist who is passionate about data-driven analysis. 
The notebook entitled "Kmeans_Clustering_Foursquare_and_Wiki_Data" scrapes Wikipedia for Toronto postal data and assigns geographic coordinates using geocoder.arcgis. I then retrieve Foursquare data on venues in Toronto proper, and use the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster neighborhoods based on the results.
The notebook entitled "Explaining_NYC_COVID19_Cases" performs a zip-code level analysis of COVID-19 incidence in New York City using regression and machine learning techniques. The results of this analysis are described in the "Explaining_NYC_COVID19_Cases_Report" and ""Explaining_NYC_COVID19_Cases_Presentation" files.
