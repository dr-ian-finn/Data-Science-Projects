[*Clustering_Foursquare_and_Wiki_Data*](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dr-ian-finn/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Clustering_Foursquare_and_Wiki_Data.ipynb)<br /> 
This notebook scrapes Wikipedia for Toronto postal data and assigns geographic coordinates using geocoder.arcgis. I then retrieve Foursquare data on venues in Toronto proper, and use the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster neighborhoods based on the results.<br />

[*Explaining_NYC_COVID19_Cases*](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dr-ian-finn/Jupyter-Notebooks/blob/master/Explaining_NYC_COVID19_Cases.ipynb)<br />
This notebook performs a zip-code level analysis of COVID-19 incidence in New York City using regression and machine learning techniques. The results of this analysis are described in the *An Analysis of COVID-19 Incidence in New York City - Paper Format* and *An Analysis of COVID-19 Incidence in New York City - Presentation Format* files, which are located in the *Projects* folder.

The *Projects* folder contains the results of the "Explaining_NYC_COVID19_Cases" workbook in presentation and paper format.
